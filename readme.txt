New Setup Directions: Download MITgcm from mitgcm.org as usual and copy the iceplume folder into the "pkg" folder. Note that
the main difference between this version and that from Cowton et al., 2015 is the smoothing of the plume buoyancy flux (as discussed 
in the SI of Zhao et al. 2021) in iceplume_calc.f.

A test case can be set up by executing gendata.m in the input folder.
